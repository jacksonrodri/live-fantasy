                    Before making any payment, PowerPlay Systems may require that an entrant complete and
                    execute an affidavit of eligibility in which, among other things, the entrant is required to
                    represent and warrant that the entrant is eligible to participate in a Contest, is otherwise in
                    compliance with this Agreement and, potentially, is required to provide documentation or proof
                    of eligibility and compliance. If PowerPlay Systems requests that an entrant completes and
                    executes such an affidavit and the entrant fails to do so within seven (7) days, or PowerPlay
                    Systems otherwise determines that the entrant does not meet the eligibility requirements or is
                    not in compliance with these Terms, PowerPlay Systems reserves the right to terminate the
                    entrant’s Account and withhold or revoke the awarding of any prizes associated with such
                    Account. In such a situation, PowerPlay Systems may pay out any withheld or revoked prizes to
                    the other entrants in the relevant Contest in a manner consistent with the Rules of the Contest.

                    sections 313.900 to 313.1020, RSMo, in which case PowerPlay Systems may decline to honor the
                    request for withdrawal for a reasonable investigatory period until its investigation is resolved if
                    it provides notice of the nature of the investigation to you. For the purposes of this provision, a
                    request for withdrawal will be considered honored if it is processed by PowerPlay Systems but
                    delayed by a payment processor, credit card issuer, or by the custodian of a financial Account.

                    <p>
                        If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time
                        informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party

                        forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their
                        formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use
                        of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American
                        Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules
                        and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration
                        Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class

                    <p>
                        The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, provincial, or local court or agency, shall have
                        exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation,
                        applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim
                        that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to
                        arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a
                        court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties
                        and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                        If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location
                        within the United States convenient for you. For residents in Canada, arbitration shall be
                        initiated in the Province of Ontario, Canada, and you and PowerPlay Systems agree to submit to
                        the personal jurisdiction of any federal or provincial court in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in order
                        to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or
                        enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

                    <p>
                        The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities
                        only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive
            their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. <b><i>YOU AND POWERPLAY SYSTEMS
                        AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS
                        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
            PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</i></b>. If any court or arbitrator
            determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for
            any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set
            forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have
            not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

                    <p>
                        Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party
                        may bring an action in provincial, state, or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights
                        (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade
                        secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims
                        court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
