                <p>PowerPlay Systems is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure</p>
                <p>We have also implemented a number of security procedures, structures and safeguards to protect our own network, including, but not limited to, encryption, firewalls, and third-party audits. Powerplay Systems security team also monitors and regularly reviews our system's infrastructure, to detect possible weakness and updates practices, procedures and technologies pending new developments.</p>
                <p>In addition to our efforts, we strongly encourage you to use best practices to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Here are some steps you can take to protect your password:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never share your password with anyone.</li>
                    <li>Use a combination of letters, numbers and symbols (_@#$%^ =,.!).</li>
                    <li>Avoid obvious names, common words and birthdays.</li>
                    <li>Longer passwords are stronger (up to 24 total characters).</li>
                    <li>Try a mnemonic device for something only youâ€™ll remember.</li>
                    <li>Update your password on a regular basis, and make it unique from other sites.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Take these additional steps to protect your account:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When accessing the Powerplay Games Platform from a device you don't own, make sure you sign out.</li>
                    <li>Be wary of phishing scams. Blackjack Sports will never ask for your password.</li>
                    <li>Avoid bad links and questionable websites. To check where a link is taking you before you click it, rest your mouse cursor on the link and examine the URL.</li>
